# Tutorial: Gathering vulnerability intelligence

>[!IMPORTANT]
> On June 30, 2024, The Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) standalone portal (https://ti.defender.microsoft.com) will be retired and will no longer be accessible. Customers can continue using Defender TI in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://aka.ms/mdti-intel-explorer) or with [Microsoft Copilot for Security](security-copilot-and-defender-threat-intelligence.md). [Learn more](https://aka.ms/mdti-standaloneportal)


This tutorial walks you through how to perform several types of indicator searches to gather vulnerability intelligence using Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) in the Microsoft Defender portal.

## Prerequisites

- A Microsoft Entra ID or personal Microsoft account. [Sign in or create an account](https://signup.microsoft.com/)
- A Defender TI Premium license.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Users without a Defender TI Premium license can still access our free Defender TI offering.

## Disclaimer

Defender TI might include live, real-time observations and threat indicators, including malicious infrastructure and adversary-threat tooling. Any IP address and domain searches within Defender TI are safe to search. Microsoft shares online resources (for example, IP addresses, domain names) that are considered real threats posing a clear and present danger. We ask that you use their best judgment and minimize unnecessary risk while interacting with malicious systems when performing the following tutorial. Microsoft minimizes risks by defanging malicious IP addresses, hosts, and domains.

## Before you begin

As the disclaimer states previously, suspicious and malicious indicators are defanged for your safety. Remove any brackets from IP addresses, domains, and hosts when searching in Defender TI. Don't search these indicators directly in your browser.

## Open Defender TI in the Microsoft Defender portal

1. Access the [Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com/) and complete the Microsoft authentication process. [Learn more about the Defender portal](/defender-xdr/microsoft-365-defender-portal)

4. Navigate back to the **Intel explorer** search bar and search *50.116.3[.]164*.
5. Review the following results in the **Summary** tab:
   - Reputation
   - Analyst insights
   - Articles
   - Services
   - Resolutions
   - Certificates
   - Projects
