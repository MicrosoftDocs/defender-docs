# Analyst insights

>[!IMPORTANT]
> On June 30, 2024, The Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI) standalone portal (https://ti.defender.microsoft.com) will be retired and will no longer be accessible. Customers can continue using Defender TI in the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://aka.ms/mdti-intel-explorer) or with [Microsoft Copilot for Security](security-copilot-and-defender-threat-intelligence.md). [Learn more](https://aka.ms/mdti-standaloneportal)

In Microsoft Defender Threat Intelligence (Defender TI), the Analyst Insights section provides quick insights about the artifact that might help determine the next step in an investigation. This section lists any insights that apply to the artifact, and insights that don't apply for extra visibility. In the below example, we can quickly determine that the IP Address is routable, hosts a web server, and had an open port within the past five days. Furthermore, the system displays rules that weren't triggered, which can be equally helpful when kick starting an investigation.
