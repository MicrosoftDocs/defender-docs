# Train your security staff for Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR

With the urgency of protecting your organization and its data from attackers, you need to quickly onboard your security staff to Microsoft Defender XDR. Microsoft provides multiple types of learning and self-study resources for Microsoft Defender XDR and associated services.

## Microsoft Defender XDR Ninja training

[Microsoft Defender XDR Ninja training](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-defender/become-a-microsoft-365-defender-ninja/ba-p/1789376) is a set of organized sections and modules to step you through the features and functions of Microsoft Defender XDR. The training goes across the threat signal sources&mdash;such as Microsoft Defender for Endpoint and others&mdash;but does not cover the individual sources themselves. 

The content is structured into three different knowledge levels, with multiple modules: Fundamentals, Intermediate, and Expert. Each level includes a knowledge check to test your understanding of the material.

## Learning paths

Use these learning paths and their modules to build an understanding of Microsoft Defender XDR and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, one module and unit at a time.

 - [Detect and respond to cyber attacks with Microsoft Defender XDR](/training/paths/defender-detect-respond/)

 - [Secure your organization with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/training/paths/defender-endpoint-fundamentals/)

Browse the [list of learning paths](/training/browse/?products=m365-ems-cloud-app-security%2Cdefender-for-cloud-apps%2Cdefender-identity%2Cm365-information-protection%2Cm365-threat-protection%2Cmdatp%2Cdefender-office365&expanded=m365%2Coffice-365), and filter by product/service, role, level, and more.

## Hands-on with a trial environment

One of the best ways to learn is by configuring and testing Microsoft Defender XDR and its associated services in a trial environment. See [Pilot and deploy Microsoft Defender XDR](pilot-deploy-overview.md) for the details.

## Simulating an attack

To test your security staff on their ability to detect and respond to a cyberattack, use a simulated attack. See [Simulate attacks with the Microsoft Defender portal](pilot-deploy-investigate-respond.md#simulate-attacks-with-the-microsoft-365-defender-portal) for more information.
