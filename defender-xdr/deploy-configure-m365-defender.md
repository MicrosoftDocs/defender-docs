# Setup guides for Microsoft Defender XDR

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**
- Microsoft Defender XDR

Setup guides for Microsoft Defender XDR deployment give you tailored guidance and resources for planning and deploying security controls for your tenant, apps, and services. 

All setup guides are available in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2224913) and in the [Microsoft 365 Setup portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2230646).

## Setup guides

Setup guides in the admin center require authentication to a Microsoft 365 tenant as an administrator or other role with access to the admin center, but guides in the Microsoft 365 Setup portal can be accessed by anyone. The following table provides links to both locations for each guide, where available.
