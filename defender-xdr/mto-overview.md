# Microsoft Defender multitenant management

Multitenant management for Microsoft Defender XDR and the Microsoft unified security operations platform provides your security operation teams with a single, unified view of all the tenants you manage. This view enables your teams to quickly investigate incidents and perform advanced hunting across data from multiple tenants, improving your security operations.

If you have tenants with a Microsoft Sentinel workspace onboarded to the unified security operations platform, you're able to:

- Triage incidents and alerts across security information and event management (SIEM) and extended detection and response (XDR) data.
- Proactively search for SIEM and XDR data across multiple tenants.

Only one Microsoft Sentinel workspace per tenant is currently supported in the unified security operations platform. So in Microsoft Defender multitenant management, you have SIEM data from one Microsoft Sentinel workspace per tenant.

For more information, see:

- [Connect Microsoft Sentinel to Microsoft Defender XDR](microsoft-sentinel-onboard.md)
- [Multitenant organizations documentation](/azure/active-directory/multi-tenant-organizations/)

Multitenant management is also available to US government customers. Refer to the table below for specific scenarios for GCC, GCC High, DoD, and Commercial customers.

| Scenario | Availability |

## Benefits of multitenant management

Some of the key benefits you get with multitenant management for Defender XDR and the Microsoft unified security operations platform include:

- **A centralized place to manage incidents across tenants**: A unified view provides SOC analysts with all the information they need to investigate incidents across multiple tenants, eliminating the need to sign in and out of each one.

- **Streamlined threat hunting**: Multi-tenancy support enables SOC teams use Microsoft Defender XDR advanced hunting capabilities to create Kusto Query Language (KQL) queries that proactively hunt for threats across multiple tenants.

- **Multi-customer management for partners**: Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) partners can now gain visibility into security incidents, alerts, and threat hunting across multiple customers through a single pane of glass.
