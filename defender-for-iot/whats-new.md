| **OT networks** | - [Review unmanaged enterprise IoT devices in Microsoft Security Exposure Management Initiatives page](#review-unmanaged-enterprise-iot-devices-in-microsoft-security-exposure-management-initiatives-page)<br>- [New Building Management Systems (BMS) device category](#new-building-management-systems-bms-device-category)|

### Review unmanaged enterprise IoT devices in Microsoft Security Exposure Management Initiatives page

You can now review the new Enterprise IoT Security initiative in the Microsoft Security Exposure Management Initiatives page. This new initiative provides a metric-driven way of tracking exposure about unmanaged enterprise IoT devices.

For more information, see the [Microsoft Security Exposure Management release notes](/security-exposure-management/whats-new#new-enterprise-iot-security-initiative).

### New Building Management Systems (BMS) device category

We now support the new BMS device category in Defender for IoT that improves BMS device discovery and security. The BMS category includes a subset of Smart Facility and Surveillance devices (previously under the IoT category) such as fire alarms, humidity sensors, security radars, etc. Camera devices remain under the IoT category.

For more information, see [overview of device discovery](device-discovery.md).

## July 2024
