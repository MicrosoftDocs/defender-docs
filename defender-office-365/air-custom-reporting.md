# Custom or third-party reporting solutions for Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

Automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 returns detailed information about the results. For more information, see [Details and results of automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2](air-view-investigation-results.md).

However, some Microsoft 365 organizations use custom or third-party reporting solutions. Those organizations can use the **Office 365 Management Activity APIs** to integrate information from AIR into other reporting solutions.
