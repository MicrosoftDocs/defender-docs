# Automated investigation and response (AIR) examples in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

It's up to your security operations (SecOps) team to investigate security alerts and take steps to protect your organization. SecOps teams can often feel overwhelmed by the volume of alerts that require review. Automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 can help. For more information about AIR, see [Automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2](air-about.md).

AIR enables your SecOps team to operate more efficiently and effectively. AIR includes automated investigations to well-known threats, and provides recommended remediation actions. The SecOps team can review the evidence and approve or reject the recommended actions.

This article describes how AIR works through several examples:

- [Example: A user-reported phishing message launches an investigation playbook](#example-a-user-reported-phishing-message-launches-an-investigation-playbook)
- [Example: A security administrator triggers an investigation from Threat Explorer](#example-a-security-administrator-triggers-an-investigation-from-threat-explorer)
- [Example: A security operations team integrates AIR with their SIEM using the Office 365 Management Activity API](#example-a-security-operations-team-integrates-air-with-their-siem-using-the-office-365-management-activity-api)

## Example: A user-reported phishing message launches an investigation playbook

A user receives an email that looks like a phishing attempt. The user reports the message using the [Microsoft Report Message or Report Phishing add-ins](submissions-users-report-message-add-in-configure.md), which results in the following actions:

- The submission is added to the **User reported** tab of the **Submissions** page in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/reportsubmission?viewid=user>.
- Depending on the [user reported settings](submissions-user-reported-messages-custom-mailbox.md), the message is sent to Microsoft for analysis directly by the user submission or by an admin from the **User reported** page.
- An alert is triggered by the **Email reported by user as malware or phish** [alert policy](/purview/alert-policies#threat-management-alert-policies), which automatically launches the investigation playbook.

During the root investigation phase, various aspects of the reported email message are assessed. For example:

- The identified threat type.
- Who sent the message.
- Where the message was sent from (sending infrastructure).
- Whether other instances of the message were delivered or blocked.
- An assessment from our analysts.
- Whether the message is associated with any known campaigns.
- And more.

After the root investigation is complete, the playbook provides a list of recommended actions to take on the original message and the associated _entities_ (for example, attached files, included URLs, and recipients).

Next, several threat investigation and hunting steps are done:

- Identify similar email messages via email cluster searches.
- Share the signal with other platforms (for example, [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-atp/microsoft-defender-advanced-threat-protection)).
- Determine whether any users clicked through any malicious links in suspicious email messages.
- Determine whether other users reported similar messages in [Exchange Online Protection](eop-about.md) (EOP) and [Microsoft Defender for Office 365](mdo-about.md).
- Determine whether a user is compromised. This check uses signals across Office 365, [Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security), and [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory), correlating any related user activity anomalies.

During the hunting phase, risks and threats are assigned to various hunting steps. For more information, see [Details and results of an automated investigation](air-view-investigation-results.md).

Remediation is the final phase of the playbook. During this phase, remediation steps are taken, based on the investigation and hunting phases. For more information, see [Remediation actions in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](air-remediation-actions.md).

## Example: A security administrator triggers an investigation from Threat Explorer

You're in Explorer (Threat Explorer) at <https://security.microsoft.com/threatexplorerv3> in the **All email**, **Malware**, or **Phish** views. You're on the **Email** tab (view) of the details area below the chart. You select a message to investigate by using either of the following methods:

- Select one or more entries in the table by selecting the check box next to the first column. :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-take-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Take action** is available directly in the tab.

  :::image type="content" source="media/te-rtd-all-email-view-take-action.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Email view (tab) of the details table with a message selected and Take action active." lightbox="media/te-rtd-all-email-view-take-action.png":::

- Click on the **Subject** value of an entry in the table. The details flyout that opens contains :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-take-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Take action** at the top of the flyout.

  :::image type="content" source="media/te-rtd-all-email-view-email-tab-details-area-subject-details-flyout-actions-only.png" alt-text="The actions available in the details tab after you select a Subject value in the Email tab of the details area in the All email view." lightbox="media/te-rtd-all-email-view-email-tab-details-area-subject-details-flyout-actions-only.png":::

After you select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-take-actions-icon.png" border="false"::: **Take action**, select **Initiate automated investigation**. For more information, see [Email remediation](threat-explorer-threat-hunting.md#email-remediation).

Similar to playbooks triggered by an alert, automatic investigations that are triggered from Threat Explorer include:

- A root investigation.
- Steps to identify and correlate threats. For more information, see [Details and results of an automated investigation](air-view-investigation-results.md).
- Recommended actions to mitigate threats. For more information, see [Remediation actions in Microsoft Defender for Office 365](air-remediation-actions.md).

## Example: A security operations team integrates AIR with their SIEM using the Office 365 Management Activity API

AIR capabilities in Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 include [reports and details](air-view-investigation-results.md) that the SecOps team can use to monitor and address threats. But you can also integrate AIR capabilities with other solutions. For example:

- Security information and event management (SIEM) systems.
- Case management systems.
- Custom reporting solutions.

Use the [Office 365 Management Activity API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference) for integration with these solutions.

For an example of a custom solution that integrates alerts from user-reported phishing messages that were already processed by AIR into a SIEM server and case management system, see [Tech Community blog: Improve the Effectiveness of your SOC with Microsoft Defender for Office 365 and the Office 365 Management API](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-and/improve-the-effectiveness-of-your-soc-with-office-365-atp-and/ba-p/1525185).

The integrated solution greatly reduces the number of false positives, which allows the SecOps team to focus their time and effort on real threats.
