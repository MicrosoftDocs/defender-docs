# Insights and reports for Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 or Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft provides insights and reports from the results of simulations and the corresponding trainings. This information keeps you informed on the threat readiness progress of your users, and recommended next steps to better prepare your users for future attacks.

Insights and reports are available in the following locations on the **Attack simulation training** page in the Microsoft Defender portal:

- Insights:
  - The **Overview** tab at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=overview>.
  - The **Reports** tab at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=reports>.
- Reports:
  - The **Attack simulation report** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulationreport>:
    - [Training efficacy tab](#training-efficacy-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report)
    - [User coverage tab](#user-coverage-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report)
    - [Training completion tab](#training-completion-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report)
    - [Repeat offenders tab](#repeat-offenders-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report)
  - The reports for in-progress and completed simulations and training campaigns: For more information, see [Attack simulation report](#attack-simulation-report).

The rest of this article describes the reports and insights for Attack simulation training.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

## Insights on the Overview and Reports tabs of Attack simulation training

To go to the **Overview** tab, open the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training**:

- **Overview** tab: Verify that the **Overview** tab is selected (it's the default). Or, to go directly to the **Overview** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=overview>.
- **Reports** tab: Select the **Reports** tab. Or, to go directly to the **Reports** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulationreport>.

The distribution of insights on the tabs is described in the following table:

|Report|Overview tab|Reports tab|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|[Recent simulations card](#recent-simulations-card)|✔||
|[Recommendations card](#recommendations-card)|✔||
|[Simulation coverage card](#simulation-coverage-card)|✔|✔|
|[Training completion card](#training-completion-card)|✔|✔|
|[Repeat offenders card](#repeat-offenders-card)|✔|✔|
|[Behavior impact on compromise rate card](#behavior-impact-on-compromise-rate-card)|✔|✔|

The rest of this section describes the information that's available on the **Overview** and **Reports** tabs of Attack simulation training.

### Recent simulations card

The **Recent simulations** card on the **Overview** tab shows the last three simulations that you created or ran in your organization.

You can select a simulation to view details.

Selecting **View all simulations** takes you to the **Simulations** tab.

Selecting **Launch a simulation** starts the new simulation wizard. For more information, see [Simulate a phishing attack in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-overview-recent-simulations-card.png" alt-text="The Recent simulations card on the Overview tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal.":::

### Recommendations card

The **Recommendations** card on the **Overview** tab suggests different types of simulations to run.

Selecting **Launch now** starts the new simulation wizard with the specified simulation type automatically selected on the **Select technique** page. For more information, see [Simulate a phishing attack in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-overview-recommendations-card.png" alt-text="The Recommendations card on the Overview tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal.":::

### Simulation coverage card

The **Simulation coverage** card on the **Overview** and **Reports** tabs shows the percentage of users in your organization who received a simulation (**Simulated users**) vs. users who didn't receive a simulation (**Non-simulated users**). You can hover over a section in the chart to see the actual number of users in each category.

Selecting **View simulation coverage report** takes you to the [User coverage tab for the Attack simulation report](#user-coverage-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report).

Selecting **Launch simulation for non-simulated users** starts the new simulation wizard where the users who didn't receive the simulation are automatically selected on the **Target user** page. For more information, see [Simulate a phishing attack in Defender for Office 365](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md).

:::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-overview-sim-coverage-card.png" alt-text="The Simulation coverage card on the Overview tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal.":::

### Training completion card

The **Training completion** card on the **Overview** and **Reports** tabs organizes the percentages of users who received trainings based on the results of simulations into the following categories:

- **Completed**
- **In progress**
- **Incomplete**

You can hover over a section in the chart to see the actual number of users in each category.

Selecting **View training completion report** takes you to the [Training completion tab for the Attack simulation report](#training-completion-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report).

:::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-overview-training-complete-card.png" alt-text="The Training completion card on the Overview tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal.":::

### Repeat offenders card

The **Repeat offenders** card on the **Overview** and **Reports** tabs shows the information about repeat offenders. A _repeat offender_ is a user who was compromised by consecutive simulations. The default number of consecutive simulations is two, but you can change the value on the **Settings** tab of Attack simulation training at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=setting>. For more information, see [Configure the repeat offender threshold](attack-simulation-training-settings.md#configure-the-repeat-offender-threshold).

The chart organizes repeat offender data by [simulation type](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique):

- **All**
- **Malware Attachment**
- **Link to Malware**
- **Credential Harvest**
- **Link in attachments**
- **Drive-by URL**

Selecting **View repeat offender report** takes you to the [Repeat offenders tab for the Attack simulation report](#repeat-offenders-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report).

:::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-overview-repeat-offenders-card.png" alt-text="The Repeat offenders card on the Overview tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal":::

### Behavior impact on compromise rate card

The **Behavior impact on compromise rate** card on the **Overview** and **Reports** tabs shows how your users responded to your simulations as compared to the historical data in Microsoft 365. You can use these insights to track progress in users threat readiness by running multiple simulations against the same groups of users.

The chart data shows the following information:

- **Actual compromise rate**: The actual percentage of people who were compromised by the simulation (actual users compromised / total number of users in your organization who received the simulation).
- **Predicted compromise rate**: Historical data across Microsoft 365 that predicts the percentage of people who will be compromised by this simulation. To learn more about the predicted compromise rate (PCR), see [Predicted compromise rate](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#predicted-compromise-rate).

If you hover over a data point in the chart, the actual percentage values are shown.

To see a detailed report, select **View simulations and training efficacy report**. This report is explained [later in this article](#training-efficacy-tab-for-the-attack-simulation-report).

## Simulation report in Attack simulation training

The simulation report shows the details of in-progress or completed simulations (the **Status** value is **In progress** or **Completed**). To view the simulation report, use any of the following methods:

- On the **Overview** tab of the **Attack simulation training** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=overview>, select a simulation from the [Recent simulations card](#recent-simulations-card).

  :::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-overview-recent-simulations-card.png" alt-text="The Recent simulations card on the Overview tab in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal.":::

- On the **Simulations** tab of the **Attack simulation training** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=simulations>, select a simulation by clicking anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name. For more information, see [View simulation reports](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#view-simulation-reports).

  - On the **Training** tab of the **Attack simulation training** page at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=trainingcampaign>, select the training campaign using either of the following methods:
  - Click anywhere in the row other than the check box next to the name.
  - Select the check box next to the name, and then select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-eye-icon.png" border="false"::: **View report**.

  For more information, see [View Training campaign reports](attack-simulation-training-training-campaigns.md#view-training-campaign-reports).

The report page that opens contains **Report**, **Users, and **Details** tabs that contain information about the simulation. The rest of this section describes the insights and reports that are available on the **Report** tab.

The sections on the **Report** tab for a simulation are described in the following subsections.

For more information about the **Users** and **Details** tabs, see the following links.

- Simulations:
  - [Users tab](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#users-tab)
  - [Details tab](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#details-tab)
- Training campaigns:

  - [Details tab](attack-simulation-training-training-campaigns.md#details-tab)

### Reporting for QR code simulations

> [!TIP]
> QR code payloads are currently in Preview, aren't available in all organizations, and are subject to change.

You can select QR code payloads to use in simulations. The QR code replaces the phishing URL as the payload that's used in the simulation email message. For more information, see [QR code payloads](attack-simulation-training-payloads.md#qr-code-payloads).

Because QR codes are a different type of a phishing URL, user events around read, delete, compromise, and click events remain the same. For example, scanning the QR code opens the phishing URL, so the event is tracked as a click event. The existing mechanisms for tracking compromise, deletes, and report events remain the same.

If you export a [simulation report](#simulation-report-for-simulations) to a CSV file, the **EmailLinkClicked_ClickSource** column is available with the following values:

- `PhishingURL`: The user clicked on the phishing link in the simulation email message.
- `QRCode`: The user scanned the QR code in the simulation email message.

Other metrics like reads, compromises, deletes, and reported messages continue to be tracked without any additional updates. For more information, the [Appendix](#appendix) section later in this article.

|Country|The user's Country property value in Microsoft Entra ID at the time of simulation.|
|Manager|The user's Manager property value in Microsoft Entra ID at the time of simulation.|

How user activity signals are captured is described in the following table.

|Field|Description|Calculation logic|
|---|---|---|
|DownloadAttachment|A user downloaded the attachment.|The signal comes from the client (for example, Outlook or Word).|
|Opened Attachment|A user opened the attachment.|The signal comes from the client (for example, Outlook or Word).|
|Read Message|The user read the simulation message.|Message read signals might experience issues in the following scenarios: <ul><li>The user reported the message as phishing in Outlook without leaving the reading pane, and **Mark items as read when viewed in the Reading Pane** wasn't configured (default).</li><li>The user reported the unread message as phishing in Outlook, the message was deleted, and **Mark messages as read when deleted** wasn't configured (default).</li></ul>|
|Out of Office|Determines whether the user is out of office.|Currently calculated by the Automatic replies setting from Outlook.|
|Compromised User|The user was compromised. The compromise signal varies based on the social engineering technique.|<ul><li>**Credential Harvest**: The user entered their credentials on the login page (credentials aren't stored by Microsoft).¹</li><li>**Malware Attachment**: The user opened the payload attachment and selected **Enable Editing** in [Protected View](https://support.microsoft.com/office/d6f09ac7-e6b9-4495-8e43-2bbcdbcb6653).</li><li>**Link in Attachment**: The user opened the attachment and clicked on the payload link.</li><li>**Link to Malware**: The user clicked on the payload link and entered their credentials.</li><li>**Drive by URL**: The user clicked on the payload link (entering credentials isn't required).¹</li><li>**OAuth Consent Grant**: The user clicked on the payload link and accepted the prompt to share permissions.¹</li></ul>|
|Clicked Message Link|The user clicked on the payload link in the simulation message.|The URL in the simulation is unique for each user, which allows individual user activity tracking. Third-party filtering services or email forwarding can lead to false positives. For more information, see [I see clicks or compromise events from users who insist they didn't click the link in the simulation message](attack-simulation-training-faq.md#i-see-clicks-or-compromise-events-from-users-who-insist-they-didnt-click-the-link-in-the-simulation-message).|
|Forwarded Message|The user forwarded the message.||
|Replied to Message|The user replied to the message.||
|Deleted message|The user deleted the message.|The signal comes from the Outlook activity of the user. If the user reports the message as phishing, the message might be moved to the Deleted Items folder, which is identified as a deletion.|
|Permissions granted|The user shared permissions in an **OAuth Consent Grant** simulation.||

¹ The clicked link can be a selected URL or a scanned QR code (QR code support in Attack simulation training is currently in Preview).
