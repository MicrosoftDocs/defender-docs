# Review and manage remediation actions in automated investigation and response (AIR) in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Microsoft 365 organizations with [Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2](mdo-about.md#defender-for-office-365-plan-1-vs-plan-2-cheat-sheet), automated investigation and response (AIR) often results in pending remediation actions. For example:

- Soft deleting email messages or clusters.
- Turning off external mail forwarding.

These remediation actions aren't taken automatically. The remediation actions need approval by a member of the security operations (SecOps) team. The rest of this article explains how to approve or reject pending remediation actions.

> [!TIP]
> We recommend reviewing and approving or rejecting pending remediations actions as soon as possible so your automated investigations complete in a timely manner.
>
> The system checks for duplicate or overlapping investigations where the same clusters were approved multiple times. If the same investigation cluster was already approved within the previous hour, new duplicate remediations aren't processed again. This behavior doesn't remove duplicate investigations or investigation evidence, it simply deduplicates approved actions to improve remediation processing speed. For duplicate approved cluster investigations, you don't see the action details the flyout from the **History** tab on the **Action center** page in the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com/action-center/history>.

## What do you need to know before you begin?

- To see the permissions and licensing requirement for AIR, see [Required permissions and licensing for AIR](air-about.md#required-permissions-and-licensing-for-air).
- Pending actions time out after awaiting approval for one week.

## Approve or reject pending actions from the Investigations page in Defender for Office 365

Or, to go directly to the Email & collaboration **Investigations** page, use <https://security.microsoft.com/airinvestigation>.
2. On the **Investigations** page, find and an item in the list where the **Status** value is **Pending approval**. Use :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: **Filter** to filter the results by the **Status** value **Pending action**.
3. On the **Investigations** page, select the **Pending action** item by clicking on :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-open-icon.png" border="false"::: **Open in new window** in the **ID**column (don't select the check box).
