# Payloads in Attack simulation training

[!INCLUDE [MDO Trial banner](../includes/mdo-trial-banner.md)]

In Attack simulation training in Microsoft 365 E5 or Microsoft Defender for Office 365 Plan 2, a _payload_ is the link, QR code (currently in Preview), or attachment in the simulated phishing email message that's presented to users. Attack simulation training offers a robust built-in payload catalog for the available social engineering techniques. However, you might want to create custom payloads that work better for your organization.

For getting started information about Attack simulation training, see [Get started using Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md).

To see the available payloads, open the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Content library** tab \> and then select **Payloads**. Or, to go directly to the **Content library** tab where you can select **Payloads**, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>.

**Payloads** in the **Content library** tab has three tabs:

- **Global payloads**: Contains the built-in, unmodifiable payloads. These payloads are based on real-world attacks that were observed in the Microsoft data centers. Although there's no specific release schedule, we typically average 30 to 40 new payloads every month.
- **Tenant payloads**: Contains the custom payloads that you created.
- **MDO recommendations**: Payloads that are recommended by Defender for Office 365 as having considerable impact when used by attackers. The recommendations are based on identified campaigns and a high predicted compromise rate. This list is refreshed monthly. If there's no recent campaign activity in your organization (less than 60 days), the **MDO recommendations** tab might be empty.

The information that's available on the tabs is described in the following list:

- **MDO recommendations** tab: The following information is shown for each payload:
  - **Payload name**
  - **Compromised rate (%)**
  - **Recommended by**
  - **Recommendation date time**

- **Global payloads** and **Tenant payloads** tabs: The following information is shown for each payload. You can sort the payloads by clicking on an available column header. Select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-customize-icon.png" border="false"::: **Customize columns** to change the columns that are shown. The default columns are marked with an asterisk (<sup>\*</sup>):
  - **Payload name**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Type<sup>\*</sup>**: Currently, this value is always **Social engineering**.
  - **Platform**
  - **Technique**<sup>\*</sup>: One of the available [social engineering techniques](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique):
    - **Credential Harvest**
    - **Malware Attachment**
    - **Link in Attachment**
    - **Link to Malware**
    - **Drive-by URL**
    - **OAuth Consent Grant**
    - **How-to Guide**
  - **Language**<sup>\*</sup>: If the payload contains multiple translations, the first two languages are shown directly. To see the remaining languages, hover over the numeric icon (for example, **+10**).
  - **Simulations launched**<sup>\*</sup>: The number of launched simulations that use the payload.
  - **Source**
  - **Predicted compromised rate (%)**<sup>\*</sup>: Historical data across Microsoft 365 that predicts the percentage of people who will be compromised by this payload (users compromised / total number of users who receive the payload). For more information, see [Predicted compromise rate](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#predicted-compromise-rate).
  - **Created by**<sup>\*</sup>: For built-in payloads, the value is **Microsoft**. For custom payloads, the value is the user principal name (UPN) of the user who created the payload.
  - **Last modified**<sup>\*</sup>
  - **Status**<sup>\*</sup>: Values are:
    - **Ready**
    - **Draft**: Available only on the **Tenant payloads** tab.
    - **Archive**: Archived payloads are visible only when **Show archived payloads** is toggled on :::image type="icon" source="media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.
  - **⋮** (**Actions** control)<sup>\*</sup>: Take action on the payload. The available actions depend on the **Status** value of the payload as described in the procedure sections. This control always appears at the end of the payload row.

  > [!TIP]
  > To see all columns, you likely need to do one or more of the following steps:
  >
  > - Horizontally scroll in your web browser.
  > - Narrow the width of appropriate columns.
  > - Remove columns from the view.
  > - Zoom out in your web browser.

  To find a payload in the list, type part of the payload name in the :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box and then press the ENTER key.

  Select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-filter-icon.png" border="false"::: to filter the payloads by one or of the following values:

  - **Technique**: One of the available [social engineering techniques](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-social-engineering-technique):

  - **Compromised rate**
  - **Action**: Clicking the **View details** link takes you to the details of the simulation.

To see payloads that have been archived (the **Status** value is **Archive**), use the **Show archived payloads** toggle on the **Tenant payloads** tab.

## QR code payloads

> [!TIP]
> QR code payloads are currently in Preview, aren't available in all organizations, and are subject to change.

On the **Global payloads** tab of **Content library** \> **Payloads** at <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary&source=global>, you can see the built-in, unmodifiable QR code payloads by typing **QR** in the :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-search-icon.png" border="false"::: **Search** box, and then pressing the ENTER key.

QR code payloads are available in five languages to address real-world scenarios that involve QR code attacks.

:::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-payloads-global-qr-codes.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Global payloads tab showing the QR code payloads returned after searching for the value QR." lightbox="media/attack-sim-training-payloads-global-qr-codes.png":::

You can also create custom payloads that use QR codes as phishing links as described in the next section.

> [!TIP]
> Before you use a QR code payload in simulations, be sure to examine the available fields and content in the payload.

## Create payloads

> [!NOTE]
> Certain trademarks, logos, symbols, insignias and other source identifiers receive heightened protection under local, state and federal statutes and laws. Unauthorized use of such indicators can subject the users to penalties, including criminal fines. Though not an extensive list, this includes the Presidential, Vice Presidential, and Congressional seals, the CIA, the FBI, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, the United States Internal Revenue Service, and the Olympics. Beyond these categories of trademarks, use and modification of any third-party trademark carries an inherent amount of risk. Using your own trademarks and logos in a payload would be less risky, particularly where your organization permits the use. If you have any further questions about what is or is not appropriate to use when creating or configuring a payload, you should consult with your legal advisors.

1. In the Microsoft Defender portal at <https://security.microsoft.com>, go to **Email & collaboration** \> **Attack simulation training** \> **Content library** tab \> **Payloads** \> **Tenant payloads** tab. To go directly to the **Content library** tab where you can select **Payloads** and the **Tenant payloads** tab, use <https://security.microsoft.com/attacksimulator?viewid=contentlibrary>.

   On the **Tenant payloads** tab, select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-create-icon.png" border="false"::: **Create a payload** to start the new payload wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-payload-create.png" alt-text="Create a payload on the Tenant payloads tab in Payloads in Attack simulation training in the Microsoft Defender portal." lightbox="media/attack-sim-training-payload-create.png":::

   > [!NOTE]
   > At any point after you name the payload during the new payload wizard, you can select **Save and close** to save your progress and continue later. The incomplete payload has the **Status** value **Draft**. You can pick up where you left off by selecting the payload and then clicking the :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-edit-icon.png" border="false"::: **Edit payload** action that appears.
   >
   > You can also create payloads during the creation of simulations. For more information, see [Create a simulation: Select a payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page).

2. On the **Select type** page, select one of the following values:
   - **Email**
   - **Teams**: Currently, this value is available only in Private Preview. For more information, see [Microsoft Teams in Attack simulation training](attack-simulation-training-teams.md).

   When you're finished on the **Select type** page, select **Next**.

3. On the **Select technique** page, the available options are the same as on the **Select technique** page in the new simulation wizard:
   - **Credential Harvest**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Malware Attachment**
   - **Link in Attachment**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Link to Malware**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **Drive-by URL**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **OAuth Consent Grant**<sup>\*</sup>
   - **How-to Guide**

   <sup>\*</sup> This social engineering technique allows you to use QR codes (currently in Preview).

   For more information about the different social engineering techniques, see [Simulations](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#simulations).

   When you're finished on the **Select technique** page, select **Next**.

4. On the **Payload name** page, configure the following settings:

   - **Name**: Enter a unique, descriptive name for the payload.
   - **Description**: Enter an optional detailed description for the payload.

   When you're finished on the **Payload name** page, select **Next**.

5. On the **Configure payload** page, it's time to build your payload. Many of the available settings are determined by the selection you made on the **Select technique** page (for example, links vs. attachments).

   - **Sender details** section: Configure the following settings:
     - **From name**
     - **Use first name as display name**: By default, this setting isn't selected.
     - **From email**: If you choose an internal email address for your payload's sender, the payload appears to come from a fellow employee. This sender email address increases a user's susceptibility to the payload, and helps to educate employees on the risk of internal threats.
     - **Email subject**
     - **Add External tag to email**: By default, this setting isn't selected.

   - **Attachment details** section (**Malware Attachment**, **Link in Attachment**, or **Link to Malware** techniques only): Configure the following settings:
     - **Name your attachment**: Enter a filename for the attachment.
     - **Select an attachment type**: Select a filetype for the attachment. Available values are **Docx** or **HTML**.

   - **Phishing link** or **Link for attachment** sections:
     - The **Phishing link** section is available only in the **Credential Harvest**, **Link in Attachment**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** techniques.
     - The **Link for attachment** section is available only in the **Link to Malware** technique.

     Select **Select URL**. In the details flyout that opens, select one of the available URLs, and then select **Confirm**.

     To change the URL, select **Change URL**.

     > [!NOTE]
     > The available URLs are listed in [Simulations](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#simulations).
     >
     > Check the availability of the simulated phishing URL in your supported web browsers before you use the URL in a phishing campaign. For more information, see [Phishing simulation URLs blocked by Google Safe Browsing](attack-simulation-training-faq.md#phishing-simulation-urls-blocked-by-google-safe-browsing).

   - **Attachment content** section (**Link in Attachment** technique only).

     A rich text editor is available to create the attachment content. To see the typical font and formatting settings, toggle **Formatting controls** to :::image type="icon" source="media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false"::: **On**.

     Select the **Phishing link** box. In the **Name phishing URL** dialog that opens, enter a **Name** value for the URL that you selected in the **Phishing link** section, and then select **Confirm**.

     The name value that you entered is added to the attachment content as a link to the phishing URL.

   - Common settings for all techniques on the **Configure payload** page:
     - **Add tag(s)**
     - **Theme**: The available values are: **Account Activation**, **Account Verification**, **Billing**, **Clean up Mail**, **Document Received**, **Expense**, **Fax**, **Finance Report**, **Incoming Messages**, **Invoice**, **Item Received**, **Login Alert**, **Mail**, **Password**, **Payment**, **Payroll**, **Personalized Offer**, **Quarantine**, **Remote Work**, **Review Message**, **Security Update**, **Service Suspended**, **Signature Required**, **Upgrade Mailbox Storage**, **Verify mailbox**, **Voicemail**, or **Other**.

     - **Current event**: The available values are **Yes** or **No**.
     - **Controversial**: The available values are **Yes** or **No**.
     - **Language** section: Select the language for the payload. The available values are: **English**, **Spanish**, **German**, **Japanese**, **French**, **Portuguese**, **Dutch**, **Italian**, **Swedish**, **Chinese (Simplified)**, **Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)**, **Norwegian Bokmål**, **Polish**, **Russian**, **Finnish**, **Korean**, **Turkish**, **Hungarian**, **Hebrew**, **Thai**, **Arabic**, **Vietnamese**, **Slovak**, **Greek**, **Indonesian**, **Romanian**, **Slovenian**, **Croatian**, **Catalan**, or **Other**.

     - **Email message** section:
       - You can select **Import email** and then **Choose file** to import an existing plain text message file. Two tabs are available:
       - **Text** tab: A rich text editor is available to create the payload. To see the typical font and formatting settings, toggle **Formatting controls** to :::image type="icon" source="media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false"::: **On**.

         > [!TIP]
         > The **Formatting controls** bar contains an **Insert QR code** action that you can use instead of selecting **Insert QR code** control from the **Dynamic tag** dropdown list for applicable social engineering techniques (currently in Preview):
         >
         > :::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-payloads-formatting-controls-insert-qr-code.png" alt-text="The Insert QR code action in the formatting controls on the Configure payload page of the new payload creation wizard.":::
         >
         > See the **Insert QR code** control description for details about adding QR codes to a payload.

         The following controls are also available on the **Text** tab:

         - **Dynamic tag**: Select from the following tags:

            |Tag name|Tag value|
            |---|---|
            |**Insert User name**|`${userName}`|
            |**Insert First name**|`${firstName}`|
            |**Insert Last name**|`${lastName}`|
            |**Insert UPN**|`${upn}`|
            |**Insert Email**|`${emailAddress}`|
            |**Insert Department**|`${department}`|

            |**Insert City**|`${city}`|
            |**Insert Date**|`${date|MM/dd/yyyy|offset}`|

         - The **Insert QR code** control (currently in Preview) is available only in the **Credential Harvest**, **Drive-by URL**, **OAuth Consent Grant**, or **How-to Guide** techniques.

           Instead of using a link as the phishing payload in the message, you can use a QR code. Selecting the **Insert QR code** control opens the **Insert QR code** flyout where you configure the following information:

           - **Size**: Select one of the following values:
             - **Small (50 x 50 pixels)**
             - **Medium (100 x 100 pixels)**
             - **Large (150 x 150 pixels)**
           - **Horizontal position**: Enter the horizontal location in centimeters. Use the next **From** box to specify the horizontal starting point to measure from:
             - **Top left corner**
             - **Center**
           - **Vertical position**: Enter the vertical location in centimeters. Use the next **From** box to specify the vertical starting point to measure from:
             - **Top left corner**
             - **Center**

           :::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-payloads-insert-qr-code-flyout.png" alt-text="The Insert QR code flyout from the Configure payload page of the new payload creation wizard.":::

           When you're finished on the **Insert QR code** flyout, select **Save**.

           :::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-payloads-qr-code-inserted.png" alt-text="QR code inserted in the email message of the payload during payload creation.":::

           > [!TIP]
           >
           > - The QR code maps to the phishing URL that you selected in the **Phishing link** section \> **Select URL**. When the payload is used in a simulation, the service replaces the QR code with a dynamically generated QR code to track click and compromise metrics. The size, position, and shape of the QR code matches the configuration options you configured in the payload.
           > - If you use the **Send a test** button on the **Review payload** page (Step 7), you see the QR code, but it points the phishing URL that you selected. The dynamic QR code is generated when the payload is used in a real simulation.
           > - The QR code is inserted in the email message as an image. If you switch from the **Text** tab to the **Code** tab, you see the inserted image in Base64 format. The beginning of the image contains `<div id="QRcode"...>`. Verify the finished payload contains `<div id="QRcode"...>` before you use it in a simulation. For example:
           >
           >   ```xml
           >   <div id="QRcode" style="position: absolute; margin-top: 2%; margin-left: 2%;"><img src="data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAM0AAADNCAYAAAAbvPRpAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsMAAA7DAcdvqGQAAA9cSURBVHhe7dNBDiM7EgPRvv+l/1zgLVggIXm6FU...
           >   ```
           >
           > - Verify the login page while using the payload in a simulation. You can also create login pages during the creation of simulations. For more information, see [Create a simulation: Select a payload and login page](attack-simulation-training-simulations.md#select-a-payload-and-login-page).
           > - We recommend conducting a test simulation to validate the end to end flow before using the payload with a larger audience.

         - The **Phishing link** or **Malware attachment** control is available:
           - **Phishing link** is available only in the **Credential Harvest**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** techniques.
           - **Malware attachment link** is available only in the **Link to Malware**.

           After you select the control, a **Name phishing URL** dialog opens. Enter a **Name** value for the URL that you selected in the **Phishing link** or **Link for attachment** section, and then select **Confirm**.

           The name value that you entered is added to the message body as a link to the phishing URL. On the **Code** tab, the link value is `<a href="${phishingUrl}" target="_blank">Name value you specified</a>`.

         > [!TIP]
         > To add images, copy (CTRL+C) and paste (CTRL+V) the image into the editor on the **Text** tab. The editor automatically converts the image to Base64 as part of the HTML code. The maximum payload size for a simulation is 4MB.

       - **Code** tab: You can view and modify the HTML code directly.

       - **Replace all links in the email message with the phishing link** (**Credential Harvest**, **Link to Malware**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** techniques only): This toggle can save time by replacing all links in the message with the previously selected **Phishing link** or **Link for attachment** URL. To take this action, toggle the setting to on :::image type="icon" source="media/scc-toggle-on.png" border="false":::.

   - **Predicted compromised rate** section: Select **Predict compromise rate** to calculate the predicted success rate of the payload. For more information, see [Predicted compromise rate](attack-simulation-training-get-started.md#predicted-compromise-rate).

   When you're finished on the **Configure payload** page, select **Next**.

   > [!TIP]
   > For the **How-to Guide** technique, you go directly to the **Review payload** page.

6. The **Add indicators** page is available only if you selected **Credential Harvest**, **Link in Attachment**, **Drive-by URL**, or **OAuth Consent Grant** on the **Select technique** page.

   Indicators help employees identify the tell-tale signs of phishing messages.

   On the **Add indicators** page, select :::image type="icon" source="media/m365-cc-sc-add-internal-icon.png" border="false"::: **Add indicator**. In the **Add indicator** flyout that opens, configure the following settings:

   - **Select and indicator you would like to use** and **Where do you want to place this indicator on the payload?**:

     These values are interrelated. Where you can place the indicator depends on the type of indicator. The available values are described in the following table:

     |Indicator type|Indicator location|
     |---|---|
     |**Attachment type**|Message body|
     |**Distracting detail**|Message body|
     |**Domain spoofing**|Message body <br/><br/> From email address|
     |**Generic greeting**|Message body|
     |**Humanitarian appeals**|Message body|
     |**Inconsistency**|Message body|
     |**Lack of sender details**|Message body|
     |**Legal language**|Message body|
     |**Limited time offer**|Message body|
     |**Logo imitation or dated branding**|Message body|
     |**Mimics a work or business process**|Message body|
     |**No/minimal branding**|Message body|
     |**Poses as friend, colleague, supervisor, or authority figure**|Message body|
     |**Request for sensitive information**|Message body|
     |**Security indicators and icons**|Message body <br/><br/> Message subject|
     |**Sender display name and email address**|From name <br/><br/> From email address|
     |**Sense of urgency**|Message body <br/><br/> Message subject|
     |**Spelling and grammar irregularities**|Message body <br/><br/> Message subject|
     |**Threatening language**|Message body <br/><br/> Message subject|
     |**Too good to be true offers**|Message body|
     |**Unprofessional looking design or formatting**|Message body|
     |**URL hyperlinking**|Message body|
     |**You're special**|Message body|

     This list is curated to contain the most common clues that appear in phishing messages.

     If you select the email message subject or the message body as the location for the indicator, **Select text** appears. In the **Select required text** flyout that opens, select (highlight) the text in the message subject or message body where you want the indicator to appear. When you're finished, select **Select**.

     :::image type="content" source="media/attack-sim-training-payloads-add-indicators-select-location.png" alt-text="The Selected text location in the message body to add to an indicator in the new payload wizard in Attack simulation training":::

     Back on the **Add indicator** flyout, the selected text appears in the **Text selected** section.

   - **Indicator description**: You can accept the default description for the indicator or you can customize it.

   - **Indicator preview**: To see what the current indicator looks like, click anywhere within the section.
