# Predefined classifications

Security Exposure Management provides an out-of-the-box catalog of predefined critical asset classifications for assets that include devices, identities, and cloud resources.

You can [review and classify critical assets](classify-critical-assets.md), turning them on and off as needed.

To suggest new critical asset classifications, use the **Feedback** button.

Current asset types are:

* [Device](#device)
* [Identity](#identity)
* [Cloud resource](#cloud-resource)

Immutability stores business data in a write once read many (WORM) state, and usually indicates that the storage account holds critical or sensitive data that must be protected from modification. |
| Immutable and Locked Azure Storage                           | Cloud resource | High                      | This rule applies to Azure storage accounts that have immutability support enabled with a locked policy. Immutability stores business data in a write once read many (WORM). Data protection is increased with a locked policy to ensure that data can’t be deleted or its retention time shortened. These settings usually indicate that the storage account holds critical or sensitive data that must be protected from modification or deletion. Data might also need to align with compliance policies for data protection. |
| Azure Virtual Machine with a Critical User Signed-in         | Cloud resource | High                      | This rule applies to virtual machines protected by Defender for Endpoint, where a user with a high or very high criticality level is signed in. The signed-in user can be through a joined or registered device, an active browser session, or other means. |
| Azure Key Vaults with Many Connected Identities              | Cloud resource | High                      | This rule identifies Key Vaults that can be accessed by a large number of identities, compared to other Key Vaults. This often indicates that the Key Vault is used by critical workloads, such as production services. |
