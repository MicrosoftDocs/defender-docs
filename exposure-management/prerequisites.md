# Prerequisites and support

This article describes the requirements and prerequisites for using Microsoft Security Exposure Management.

Security Exposure Management is currently in public preview.

[!INCLUDE [prerelease](../includes/prerelease.md)]

## Permissions

Permissions are based on [Microsoft Entra ID RBAC](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/custom-overview). You need a tenant with at least one Global Admin or Security Admin to create a Security Exposure Management workspace.

- For full Security Exposure Management access, user roles need access to all Defender for Endpoint  [device groups](/microsoft-365/security//defender-endpoint/machine-groups).
- Users who have access restricted to specific device groups can:
    - Access global exposure insights data. They can't access specific device information and attack paths
    - Access the Security Exposure Management attack surface map and advanced hunting schemas (ExposureGraphNodes and ExposureGraphEdges) for the device groups to which they have access.

### Permissions for Security Exposure Management tasks

For full access, users need one of the following Microsoft Entra ID roles:

- **Global Admin** (read and write permissions)
- **Global Reader** (read permissions)
- **Security Admin** (read and write permissions)
- **Security Operator** (read and limited write permissions)
- **Security Reader** (read permissions)

Permission levels are summarized in the table.

## Browser requirements

You can access Security Exposure Management in the Microsoft Defender portal using Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer 11, or any HTML 5 compliant web browser.

## Critical asset classification

- Before you start, learn about [critical asset management](critical-asset-management.md) in Security Exposure Management.
- [Review required permissions](prerequisites.md#permissions) for working with the critical assets.
- When classifying critical assets, we support devices running version 10.3740.XXXX of the Defender for Endpoint sensor or later. We recommended running a more recent sensor version, as listed on the Defender for Endpoint [What's New page](/defender-endpoint/windows-whatsnew).

    You can check which sensor version a device is running as follows:

    - On a specific device, browse to the MsSense.exe file in
C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. Right-click the file, and select **Properties**. On the **Details** tab, check the file version.
    - For multiple devices, it's easier to run an [advanced hunting Kusto query](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-query-language) to check device sensor versions, as follows:

        ``` DeviceInfo | project DeviceName, ClientVersion ```
