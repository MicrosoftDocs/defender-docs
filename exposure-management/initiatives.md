# Review security initiatives

[Microsoft Security Exposure Management](microsoft-security-exposure-management.md) offers a focused, metric-driven way of tracking exposure in specific security areas using security initiatives. This article describes how to work with initiatives.

Security Exposure Management is currently in public preview.

## Prerequisites

## Check trends

The changes in your score provide you with useful feedback about how well you're meeting the goals of your initiatives.

1. For initiatives with metrics, you can examine this data per metric as well.

## Check history

1. Select an initiative to open the small overview and then select **Open initiative page-> History** to view changes over time.

1. Browse to the time table to choose a specific time point to examine.
    1. If needed, filter for specific time points.
