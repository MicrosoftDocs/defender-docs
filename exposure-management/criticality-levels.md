# Predefined classifications

Security Exposure Management provides an out-of-the-box catalog of predefined critical asset classifications for assets that include devices, identities, and cloud resources.

You can [review and classify critical assets](classify-critical-assets.md), turning them on and off as needed.

To suggest new critical asset classifications, use the **Feedback** button.

| Classification                                               | Asset type                 | Default Criticality Level | Description                                                  | Why is this critical?                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| AAD Connect                                                  | device                     | High                      | The Entra ID Connect (formly known as AAD Connect) server is responsible for syncing on-premises directory data to your Azure Entra ID. If it fails, it may disrupt the synchronization process and user authentication, but won't immediately halt all operations as there are potential manual workarounds. However, it should be given a high priority due to its important role in hybrid cloud environments. | A compromised EntraID Connect server could result in the entire domain being compromised. An attacker might steal the credentials of synchronized users to execute lateral movements and gain unauthorized access to resources within the network. |
| ADCS                                                         | device                     | High                      | ADCS is critical for managing digital certificates in the network. If it fails, it could result in authentication and encryption issues. However, given that certificates typically have a long lifespan and that there are usually redundant servers, the immediate impact of a failure might not be as high as with some other systems. |                                                              |
| ADFS                                                         | device                     | High                      | ADFS is crucial for Single Sign-On (SSO) and web-based authentication. If it fails, it could result in users being unable to access essential services. This is similar to the Domain Controller in that it may have redundancy, but failure could still limit capacity assurance. | A compromised ADFS server can result in credential theft and token manipulation related attacks. If an attacker gains access to the ADFS certificate's private key, they can impersonate users, thereby gaining unauthorized access to resources. |
| Backup                                                       | device                     | High                      | Backup server os responsible for safeguarding data through regular backups, ensuring data protection and disaster recovery readiness | A compromised backup server can result in the compromise of an organization's sensitive data. An attacker with access to the backup server can access backup files of critical services to export data or even encrypt them. |
| Domain Admin Machines                                        | privileged identity device | High                      | These machines have elevated privileges and are critical for maintaining and managing the domain. A failure could result in significant disruption to maintenance activities and pose a security risk, similar to the Domain Controller. | A compromised device with domain admin privileges can lead to the compromise of the entire domain. An attacker may steal cached credentials from domain admin devices to perform lateral movement within the network. |
| Domain Controller                                            | device                     | High                      | Domain controller server is responsible for user authentication, authorization, and centralized management of network resources within an active directory domain. | A compromised domain controller can have severe impacts on an organization. It could potentially allow an attacker to gain control over the entire IT infrastructure and gain access to every resource within the network. |
| Exchange                                                     | device                     | High                      | Exchange server is responsible for all the mail traffic within the organization. Depending on the setup and architecture, each server might hold several mail databases that store highly sensitive organizational information. | A compromised Exchange server can lead to the theft of an organization's sensitive mail data or even result in the encryption of the entire mail system. Additionally, an Exchange server has control over active directory objects. If these are manipulated by an attacker, it could compromise the active directory. |
| SCCM                                                         | device                     | High                      | SCCM is used for managing systems in a large network, including patch management, software distribution, and inventory management. If it fails, it might disrupt these management tasks but not directly impact daily operations of end users. | A compromised SCCM server can put the entire domain's assets at risk. An attacker with access to the SCCM server can leverage the SCCM agent to perform various high-privilege tasks on targeted assets within the domain. |
| ITAdminDevice                                                | privileged identity device | Medium                    | Critical devices used to configure, manage and monitor the assets within the organization are vital for IT administration and are at high risk of cyber threats. They require top-level security to prevent unauthorized access. | A compromised IT admin device can result in the entire domain of the organization being compromised. An attacker with access to the IT admin device can compromise the credentials of privileged users and carry out lateral movement to critical services across the domain. |
| Vmware vCenter                                               | device                     | NA                        | The VMware vCenter Server is crucial for managing virtual environments. It provides centralized management of virtual machines and ESXi hosts. If it fails, it could disrupt the administration and control of your virtual infrastructure, including provisioning, migration, load balancing of virtual machines, and datacenter automation. However, as there are often redundant vCenter Servers and High Availability configurations, the immediate halt of all operations might not occur. Its failure could still cause significant inconvenience and potential performance issues | A compromised vCenter server can result in the entire virtual infrastructure of the organization being compromised. Attackers often target vCenter servers to disrupt the organization's operations by modifying, encrypting, or deleting virtual machines, and in some cases, even their backups. |
| Identity with Privileged Azure Role                          | Identity                   | High                      | The following identities (User, Group, Service Principal, or Managed Identity) have an assigned built-in or custom privileged Azure RBAC role, at subscription scope, containing a critical resource. The role can include permissions for Azure role assignments, modifying Azure policies, executing scripts on a VM using Run command, read-access to storage accounts and keyvaults, and more. | A compromised user in this role poses a severe risk, depending on the role's permissions, the user can be used to gain access to the critical resources inside the subscription, disrupt business, access sensitive data, delete critical resources, execute scripts on critical compute resources, create role-assignments to elevate privileges, modify Azure policies for defence evasion or persistence, and more. |

Immutability stores business data in a write once read many (WORM). Data protection is increased with a locked policy to ensure that data can’t be deleted or its retention time shortened. These settings usually indicate that the storage account holds critical or sensitive data that must be protected from modification or deletion. Data might also need to align with compliance policies for data protection. |                                                              |
| Virtual Machine has a critical signed-in user                | Cloud Resource             | High                      | This rule applies to virtual machines protected by Defender for Endpoint, where a user with a high or very high criticality level is signed in. The signed-in user can be through a joined or registered device, an active browser session, or other means. |                                                              |
| Azure Key Vaults with Many Connected Identities              | Cloud Resource             | High                      | This rule identifies Key Vaults that can be accessed by a large number of identities, compared to other Key Vaults. This often indicates that the Key Vault is used by critical workloads, such as production services. |                                                              |
