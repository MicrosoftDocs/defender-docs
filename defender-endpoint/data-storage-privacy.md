## What are we collecting?

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint collects information from your configured devices and stores it in a customer-dedicated and segregated tenant specific to the service for administration, tracking, and reporting purposes.

Information collected includes file data (file names, sizes, and hashes), process data (running processes, hashes), registry data, network connection data (host IPs and ports), and device details (device identifiers, names, and the operating system version).

Microsoft stores this data securely in Microsoft Azure and maintains it in accordance with Microsoft privacy practices and  [Microsoft Trust Center policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=827578).

This data enables Defender for Endpoint to:
