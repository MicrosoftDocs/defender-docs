> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article contains instructions for how to set preferences for Defender for Endpoint on Linux in enterprise environments. If you are interested in configuring the product on a device from the command-line, see [Resources](linux-resources.md#configure-from-the-command-line).

In enterprise environments, Defender for Endpoint on Linux can be managed through a configuration profile. This profile is deployed from the management tool of your choice. Preferences managed by the enterprise take precedence over the ones set locally on the device. In other words, users in your enterprise aren't able to change preferences that are set through this configuration profile. If exclusions were added through the managed configuration profile, they can only be removed through the managed configuration profile. The command line works for exclusions that were added locally.

This article describes the structure of this profile (including a recommended profile that you can use to get started) and instructions on how to deploy the profile.

## Configuration profile structure

The configuration profile is a .json file that consists of entries identified by a key (which denotes the name of the preference), followed by a value, which depends on the nature of the preference. Values can be simple, such as a numerical value, or complex, such as a nested list of preferences.

Typically, you would use a configuration management tool to push a file with the name ```mdatp_managed.json``` at the location ```/etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/managed/```.

The top level of the configuration profile includes product-wide preferences and entries for subareas of the product, which are explained in more detail in the next sections.

### Antivirus engine preferences

The *antivirusEngine* section of the configuration profile is used to manage the preferences of the antivirus component of the product.

|**Data type**|Dictionary (nested preference)|Collapsed Section|
|**Comments**|See the following sections for a description of the dictionary contents.|See the following sections for a description of the policy properties.|

#### Enforcement level for antivirus engine

Specifies the enforcement preference of antivirus engine. There are three values for setting enforcement level:

- Real-time (`real_time`): Real-time protection (scan files as they're modified) is enabled.
- On-demand (`on_demand`): Files are scanned only on demand. In this:
  - Real-time protection is turned off.
- Passive (`passive`): Runs the antivirus engine in passive mode. In this:
  - Real-time protection is turned off: Threats are not remediated by Microsoft Defender Antivirus.
  - On-demand scanning is turned on: Still use the scan capabilities on the endpoint.
  - Automatic threat remediation is turned off: No files will be moved and security admin is expected to take required action.
  - Security intelligence updates are turned on: Alerts will be available on security admins tenant.

#### Unmonitor Filesystems

Configure filesystems to be unmonitored/excluded from Real Time Protection(RTP). The filesystems configured are validated against Microsoft Defender's list of permitted filesystems. Only post successful validation, will the filesystem be allowed to be unmonitored. These configured unmonitored filesystems will still be scanned by Quick, Full, and custom scans.

|Description|JSON Value|Defender Portal Value|
|---|---|---|
|**Key**|unmonitoredFilesystems|Unmonitored Filesystems|
|**Data type**|Array of strings|Dynamic String List|

> [!NOTE] 
> Configured filesystem will be unmonitored only if it is present in Microsoft's list of permitted unmonitored filesystems.

By default, NFS and Fuse are unmonitored from RTP, Quick, and Full scans. However, they can still be scanned by a custom scan. For example, to remove NFS from the list of unmonitored filesystems list, update the managed config file as shown below. This will automatically add NFS to the list of monitored filesystems for RTP.

```JSON
{
   "antivirusEngine":{
      "unmonitoredFilesystems": ["Fuse"]
  }
}
```
To remove both NFS and Fuse from unmonitored list of filesystems, do the following

```JSON
{
   "antivirusEngine":{
      "unmonitoredFilesystems": []
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Here;s the default list of monitored filesystems for RTP: `btrfs`, `ecryptfs`, `ext2`, `ext3`, `ext4`, `fuseblk`, `jfs`, `overlay`, `ramfs`, `reiserfs`, `tmpfs`, `vfat`, `xfs`.
>
> If any monitored filesystem needs to be added to the list of unmonitored filesystems,then it needs to be evaluated and enabled by Microsoft via cloud config. Following which customers can update managed_mdatp.json to unmonitor that filesystem.

## Recommended configuration profile

To get started, we recommend the following configuration profile for your enterprise to take advantage of all protection features that Defender for Endpoint provides.

The following configuration profile will:

- Enable real-time protection (RTP)
- Specify how the following threat types are handled:
  - **Potentially unwanted applications (PUA)** are blocked
  - **Archive bombs** (file with a high compression rate) are audited to the product logs
- Enable automatic security intelligence updates
- Enable cloud-delivered protection
- Enable automatic sample submission at `safe` level

### Sample profile

```JSON
{
   "antivirusEngine":{
      "enforcementLevel":"real_time",
      "threatTypeSettings":[
         {
            "key":"potentially_unwanted_application",
            "value":"block"
         },
         {
            "key":"archive_bomb",
            "value":"audit"
         }
      ]
   },
   "cloudService":{
      "automaticDefinitionUpdateEnabled":true,
      "automaticSampleSubmissionConsent":"safe",
      "enabled":true,
      "proxy": "<EXAMPLE DO NOT USE> http://proxy.server:port/"
   }
}
```

## Full configuration profile example

The following configuration profile contains entries for all settings described in this document and can be used for more advanced scenarios where you want more control over the product.
  
> [!NOTE]
> It is not possible to control all Microsoft Defender for Endpoint communication with only a proxy setting in this JSON.

   }
}
```

## Add tag or group ID to the configuration profile

When you run the `mdatp health` command for the first time, the value for the tag and group ID will be blank. To add tag or group ID to the `mdatp_managed.json` file, follow the below steps:
  
1. Open the configuration profile from the path `/etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/managed/mdatp_managed.json`.
  2. Go down to the bottom of the file, where the `cloudService` block is located.
  3. Add the required tag or group ID as following example at the end of the closing curly bracket for the `cloudService`.

```JSON
  },
  "cloudService": {
    "enabled": true,
    "diagnosticLevel": "optional",
    "automaticSampleSubmissionConsent": "safe",
    "automaticDefinitionUpdateEnabled": true,
    "proxy": "http://proxy.server:port/"
},
"edr": {
  "groupIds":"GroupIdExample",
  "tags": [
            {
            "key": "GROUP",
            "value": "Tag"
            }
          ]
      }
}
```

  >[!NOTE]
  >Add the comma after the closing curly bracket at the end of the `cloudService` block. Also, make sure that there are two closing curly brackets after adding Tag or Group ID block (please see the above example). At the moment, the only supported key name for tags is `GROUP`.
 
## Configuration profile validation

The configuration profile must be a valid JSON-formatted file. There are many tools that can be used to verify this. For example, if you have `python` installed on your device:

```bash
python -m json.tool mdatp_managed.json
```

If the JSON is well-formed, the above command outputs it back to the Terminal and returns an exit code of `0`. Otherwise, an error that describes the issue is displayed and the command returns an exit code of `1`.

## Verifying that the mdatp_managed.json file is working as expected

To verify that your /etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/managed/mdatp_managed.json is working properly, you should see "[managed]" next to these settings:

- cloud_enabled
- cloud_automatic_sample_submission_consent
- passive_mode_enabled
- real_time_protection_enabled
- automatic_definition_update_enabled

> [!NOTE]
> No restart of mdatp daemon is required for changes to _most_ configurations in mdatp_managed.json to take effect.
  **Exception:** The following configurations require a daemon restart to take effect:
> - cloud-diagnostic
> - log-rotation-parameters

## Configuration profile deployment

Once you've built the configuration profile for your enterprise, you can deploy it through the management tool that your enterprise is using. Defender for Endpoint on Linux reads the managed configuration from the */etc/opt/microsoft/mdatp/managed/mdatp_managed.json* file.
