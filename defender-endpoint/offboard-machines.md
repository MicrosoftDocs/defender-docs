> Want to experience Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-offboarddevices-abovefoldlink)

When you offboard a device from Defender for Endpoint, no new detections, vulnerability, or security data are sent to the Microsoft Defender portal. Seven days after offboarding a device, its status changes to [inactive](/defender-endpoint/fix-unhealthy-sensors#inactive-devices). Devices that weren't active within the past 30 days are not factored into your organization's [exposure score](/defender-vulnerability-management/tvm-exposure-score).

Past data, such as alerts, vulnerablities, and the device timeline, for an offboarded device is displayed in the Microsoft Defender portal until the [configured retention period](/defender-endpoint/data-storage-privacy#how-long-will-microsoft-store-my-data-what-is-microsofts-data-retention-policy) expires. You also see the device profile (without data) in the device inventory for up to 180 days. To view data for active devices only, you can use filters, such as [sensor health state](/defender-endpoint/machines-view-overview#use-filters-to-customize-the-device-inventory-views), [device tags](/defender-endpoint/machine-tags), or [device groups](/defender-endpoint/machine-groups).
