# Configure Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to stream Advanced Hunting events to your Azure Event Hubs

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](../microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](../microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)

> [!NOTE]
> For the full data streaming experience available, please visit [Stream Microsoft Defender XDR events | Microsoft Learn](/defender-xdr/streaming-api).

> Want to experience Defender for Endpoint? [Sign up for a free trial.](https://signup.microsoft.com/create-account/signup?products=7f379fee-c4f9-4278-b0a1-e4c8c2fcdf7e&ru=https://aka.ms/MDEp2OpenTrial?ocid=docs-wdatp-configuresiem-abovefoldlink)

## Before you begin

1. Create an [event hub](/azure/event-hubs/) in your tenant.

2. Sign in to your [Azure tenant](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), go to **Subscriptions** > **Your subscription** > **Resource Providers** > **Register to Microsoft.insights**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. This helps improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

## Enable raw data streaming

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) as a ***Security Administrator***.

2. Go to the [Data export settings page](https://security.microsoft.com/securitysettings/defender/raw_data_export) in the Microsoft Defender portal.

3. Select **Add data export settings**.

4. Choose a name for your new settings.

5. Choose **Forward events to Azure Event Hubs**.

6. Type your **Event Hubs name** and your **Event Hubs resource ID**.

> [!NOTE]
> Leaving Event Hubs name as empty will create an event hub for each category in the selected namespace. Event Hubs namespaces have a limit of 10 Event Hubs if you are not using a Dedicated Event Hubs Cluster.

   In order to get your **Event Hubs resource ID**, go to your Azure Event Hubs namespace page on [Azure](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) > properties tab \> copy the text under **Resource ID**:

7. Choose the events you want to stream and select **Save**.

## The schema of the events in Azure Event Hubs

```json
{
    "records": [
                    {
                        "time": "<The time WDATP received the event>"
                        "tenantId": "<The Id of the tenant that the event belongs to>"
                        "category": "<The Advanced Hunting table name with 'AdvancedHunting-' prefix>"
                        "properties": { <WDATP Advanced Hunting event as Json> }
                    }
                    ...
                ]
}
```

- Each event hub message in Azure Event Hubs contains list of records.

- Each record contains the event name, the time Microsoft Defender for Endpoint received the event, the tenant it belongs (you only get events from your tenant), and the event in JSON format in a property called "**properties**".

- For more information about the schema of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint events, see [Advanced Hunting overview](/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-overview).

- In Advanced Hunting, the **DeviceInfo** table has a column named **MachineGroup** which contains the group of the device. Here, every event is decorated with this column as well. For more information, see [Device Groups](../machine-groups.md).
    > [!NOTE]
    > Device group creation is supported in Defender for Endpoint Plan 1 and Plan 2.  

## Data types mapping

To get the data types for event properties, do the following:

1. Sign in to [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com) and go to [Advanced Hunting page](https://security.microsoft.com/hunting-package).

2. Run the following query to get the data types mapping for each event:

   ```kusto
   {EventType}
   | getschema
   | project ColumnName, ColumnType 
   ```

- Here's an example for Device Info event:
