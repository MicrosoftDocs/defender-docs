Detecting malware that starts early in the boot cycle was a challenge before Windows 8. In August 2012, Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MDAV) for Windows 8 or later, and Windows Server 2012 and later incorporated a new feature called the [Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM)](/windows/compatibility/early-launch-antimalware) driver. ELAM combats early boot threats (for example, rootkits or malicious drivers that can hide from detection) by using a Wdboot.sys driver that starts before other boot-start drivers. ELAM enables the evaluation of other drivers, and helps the Windows kernel decide whether those drivers should be initialized.

## Where are the ELAM detections logged?

The ELAM detection is logged in the same location as the other Microsoft Defender Antivirus threats, such as [Event ID 1006](troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus.yml).

## How do I keep the MDAV ELAM driver up to date?

The MDAV ELAM driver ships with the monthly "[Platform update](microsoft-defender-antivirus-updates.md)."

## Can the Early Launch Antimalware (ELAM) policy be modified?

ELAM can be modified here:

**Computer Configuration** \> **Administrative Templates** \> **System** \> **Early Launch Antimalware**

## How can I check that the MDAV ELAM driver is loaded?

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\EarlyLaunch
BackupPath (string) C:\Windows\\[ELAMBKUP](/windows-hardware/drivers/install/elam-driver-requirements)\WdBoot.sys (value)

## How do I revert the MDAV ELAM driver to a previous version?

C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\<antimalware platform version>\MpCmdRun.exe -[RevertPlatform](command-line-arguments-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

For example:

```dos
C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows Defender\Platform\4.18.24010.12-0\MpCmdRun.exe -RevertPlatform
```
