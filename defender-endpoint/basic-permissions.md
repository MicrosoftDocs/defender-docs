If you want to use basic permissions management for the Microsoft Defender portal, keep in mind that permissions are set to either full access or read only. For granular control over permissions, [use role-based access control](rbac.md).

## Assign user access using Microsoft Graph PowerShell

You can assign users with one of the following levels of permissions:

- Full access (Read and Write)
- Read-only access

### Before you begin

- Install Microsoft Graph PowerShell. For more information, see, [How to install Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/installation).

  > [!NOTE]
  > You need to run the PowerShell cmdlets in an elevated command-line.

- Connect to your Microsoft Entra ID. For more information, see [Connect-MgGraph](/powershell/microsoftgraph/authentication-commands).

  - **Full access**: Users with full access can log in, view all system information and resolve alerts, submit files for deep analysis, and download the onboarding package. Assigning full access rights requires adding the users to a role, such as Security Administrator, using Microsoft Entra built-in roles.

  - **Read-only access**: Users with read-only access can log in, view all alerts, and related information.

    They will not be able to change alert states, submit files for deep analysis or perform any state changing operations.

    Assigning read-only access rights requires adding the users to the "Security Reader" Microsoft Entra built-in role.

Use the following steps to assign security roles:

- For **read and write** access, assign users to the security administrator role by using the following command:

  ```PowerShell
  $Role = Get-MgDirectoryRole -Filter "DisplayName eq 'Security Administrator'"
  $UserId = (Get-MgUser -UserId "secadmin@Contoso.onmicrosoft.com").Id

  $DirObject = @{
    "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/$UserId"
  }

  New-MgDirectoryRoleMemberByRef -DirectoryRoleId $Role.Id -BodyParameter $DirObject
  ```

- For **read-only** access, assign users to the security reader role by using the following command:

  ```PowerShell
  $Role = Get-MgDirectoryRole -Filter "DisplayName eq 'Security Reader'"
  $UserId = (Get-MgUser -UserId "reader@Contoso.onmicrosoft.com").Id

  $DirObject = @{
    "@odata.id" = "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/directoryObjects/$UserId"
  }

  New-MgDirectoryRoleMemberByRef -DirectoryRoleId $Role.Id -BodyParameter $DirObject
  ```
