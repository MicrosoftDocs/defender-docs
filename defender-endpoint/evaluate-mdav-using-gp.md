# Evaluate Microsoft Defender Antivirus using Group Policy

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Defender XDR rebranding](../includes/microsoft-defender.md)]

**Applies to:**

- Microsoft Defender Antivirus
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 1](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)
- [Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Plan 2](microsoft-defender-endpoint.md)

**Platforms**:

- Windows

In Windows 10 or newer and Windows Server 2016 or newer, you can use next-generation protection features offered by Microsoft Defender Antivirus (MDAV) and Microsoft Defender Exploit Guard (Microsoft Defender EG).

This topic explains how to enable and test the key protection features in Microsoft Defender AV and Microsoft Defender EG and provides you with guidance and links to more information.

This article describes configuration options in Windows 10 or newer and Windows Server 2016 or newer.

## Use Microsoft Defender Antivirus using Group Policy to enable the features

This guide provides the Microsoft Defender Antivirus Group Policy that configures the features you should use to evaluate our protection.

1. Grab the latest 'Windows Group Policy Administrative Templates'.

   For more information, see [Create and manage Central Store - Windows Client](/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/create-and-manage-central-store#links-to-download-the-administrative-templates-files-based-on-the-operating-system-version).

   > [!TIP]
   > 1. The Windows one works with the Windows Servers.
   >
   > 1. Even if you are running a Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016, get the latest administrative templates for Windows 11 or newer.

2. Create a 'Central Store' to host the latest .admx and .adml templates.

   For more information, see [Create and manage Central Store - Windows Client](/troubleshoot/windows-client/group-policy/create-and-manage-central-store#the-central-store).

   If joined to a domain:

   1. Create a new OU block policy inheritance.

   1. Open Group policy Management Console (GPMC.msc).

   1. Go to **Group Policy Objects** and create a new Group Policy.

   1. Right-click the new policy created and select **Edit**.

   1. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**.

   or

   If joined to a workgroup

   1. Open Group Policy Editor MMC (GPEdit.msc).

   2. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Administrative Templates** > **Windows Components** > **Microsoft Defender Antivirus**.

## For False Negatives (FNs) submissions

If you have any questions about a detection that Microsoft Defender AV makes, or you discover a missed detection, you can submit a file to us.

If you have Microsoft XDR, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint P2/P1, or Microsoft Defender for Business: refer [Submit files in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint](admin-submissions-mde.md).

If you have Microsoft Defender Antivirus, refer:
https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/help/submission-help.aspx

Microsoft Defender AV indicates a detection through [standard Windows notifications](configure-notifications-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md). You can also [review detections in the Microsoft Defender AV app](review-scan-results-microsoft-defender-antivirus.md).

The Windows event log also records detection and engine events. See the [Microsoft Defender Antivirus events article for a list of event IDs](troubleshoot-microsoft-defender-antivirus.yml) and their corresponding actions.

If your settings aren't applied properly, find out if there are conflicting policies that are enabled in your environment. For more information, see [Troubleshoot Microsoft Defender Antivirus settings](troubleshoot-settings.md).

If you need to open a Microsoft support case:
